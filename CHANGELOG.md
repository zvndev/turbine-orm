# Changelog

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-05)

### Security
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed shell injection in seed command — replaced `execSync` string interpolation with `execFileSync` array args
- Migration tracking table name now quoted via `quoteIdent()` at all SQL interpolation sites
- DEFAULT value validation rejects strings containing semicolons and SQL statement keywords
- Connection string redaction (`redactUrl()`) applied to all CLI error output paths

### Added
- Column validation in `orderBy` — throws `ValidationError` for unknown column names
- Column validation in `groupBy` — throws `ValidationError` for unknown column names
- Runtime type validation in `defineSchema()` — throws for invalid column types not in TYPE_MAP
- JSON parse warning in nested relation parsing — warns instead of silently falling back
- Error handling section in README with typed error examples and error code reference
- 20 new unit tests (validation, DEFAULT edge cases, schema type checks) — 171 total

### Changed
- README messaging: "Prisma-inspired API" replaces "Prisma-compatible API"
- README tagline leads with Postgres-native positioning instead of speed claims
- Benchmark section now notes results are against Prisma 5.x / Drizzle v1 with context about modern versions
- Comparison table updated: Prisma now shown as "1 query (LATERAL JOIN + json_agg, since v5.8)"
- package.json description updated to factual positioning: "Postgres-native TypeScript ORM"
- `noExplicitAny` lint rule changed from "off" to "warn" in biome.json
- "Why Turbine?" section rewritten to lead with architectural simplicity, not speed claims

### Fixed
- Stale "Prisma sends 3 separate queries" claim in README (Prisma 7+ uses single query)
- Stale "2-3x faster than Prisma" claim in package.json description
- Stale benchmark context in query.ts header comment

## 0.5.0 (2026-03-28)

### Security
- DDL identifier quoting via `quoteIdent()` on all CREATE/ALTER/DROP statements
- DEFAULT value validation against strict allowlist
- Path traversal protection on `--out` flag
- Shell escaping for seed file paths
- `json_build_object` key escaping

### Added
- Full migration engine: `turbine migrate create/up/down/status`
  - Advisory locking for concurrent migration safety
  - Checksum validation for drift detection
  - Per-migration transactions with rollback on failure
- LRU cache (1,000 entries) for SQL query templates
- Case-insensitive LIKE support (`mode: 'insensitive'` on string filters)
- Per-query timeout option
- Configurable `defaultLimit` and `warnOnUnlimited` for findMany
- CJS output alongside ESM (dual publishing)
- Pre-computed column type lookups (O(1) instead of O(n))
- 89 unit tests (schema-builder + migrations)

### Changed
- Node.js requirement lowered from >= 22 to >= 18
- Test runner changed from `node --experimental-strip-types` to `tsx`
- `numeric` type now consistently maps to `string` (removed runtime parser)
- Middleware JSDoc clarifies that args are captured before middleware runs

### Fixed
- Test suite was completely broken (import resolution mismatch)
- `numeric`/`bigint` type mismatch between generated types and runtime
- `process.exit(0)` in integration tests killed parallel test runner
- CLI `showVersion()` was hardcoded to v0.3.0
- Test files leaked into npm package via `dist/cjs/test/`

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-26)

### Added
- `findFirst`, `findFirstOrThrow`, `findUniqueOrThrow` query methods
- Middleware system (`db.$use()`) for query interception

## 0.3.0 (2026-03-25)

### Added
- Initial public release
- Schema introspection from `information_schema` + `pg_catalog`
- Type generation (entity interfaces, create/update types, relation types)
- Query builder with `json_agg` nested relations (L2-L4 depth)
- 18+ WHERE operators (gt, gte, lt, lte, in, notIn, contains, startsWith, endsWith, OR, AND, NOT)
- JSONB operators (contains, equals, path, hasKey)
- Array operators (has, hasEvery, hasSome, isEmpty)
- Transactions with nested SAVEPOINTs and isolation levels
- Pipeline batching
- Raw SQL tagged templates
- Schema builder (`defineSchema()`) with TypeScript objects
- CLI: init, generate, push, migrate, seed, status
